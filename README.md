# Bootstrap CSS only


This is a Bower component for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS library only. No javascript/fonts, and more importantly NO bower depenedency on jQuery. Perfect companion for [Angular-UI Bootstrap](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap-bower).

Similar to [Bootstrap Assets](https://github.com/srigi/html-bootstrap-assets) but without the js and jQuery.

## Installation:

`bower install bootstrap-css-only`


### Previous Bootstrap versions also available:

```
bower install bootstrap-css-only#2.3.2
```
